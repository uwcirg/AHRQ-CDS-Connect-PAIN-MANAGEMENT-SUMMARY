## CQL Tests
The tests within this folder are unit tests run with the editor Atom and the corresponding cql plugin.  
[https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support)  
  
  
These particular tests focus around the MME calculator, and the Factors file is cut down to only include the MME calculator function.  
To run, open the files in an atom project with `input` at the head. Then select a specific cql library (in the cql folder). Right click the text and if you have the cql plugin working, the `CQL` option should appear. Select `Execute CQL` and the test results will appear in another tab.  
Results can be saved in the `results` folder, nested within `tests`. Previous tests can also be found in this folder.
